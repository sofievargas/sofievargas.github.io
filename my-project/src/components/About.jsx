           <h2>My name is Sofia Vargas, and I am a student of Barrett, the Honors College at Arizona State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Math.
            <br></br><br></br>
           My interests mainly lie in combining technology with health and sustainability. 
           I pursue these through research experiences in diverse topics pertaining to urban heat, species conservation, 
           network theory, and biosecurity. I also enjoy working with peers to promote engineering opportunities for students
           through my involvement in the Grand Challenges Scholars Program and ASU's Women in Computer Science organization.
           This summer, I am excited to gain industry experience with StateFarm as a Software Engineer Intern. 
           <br></br><br></br>
           When I am not at school, I enjoy swimming and food blogging in sunny San Diego! Feel free to browse through my past projects and find
           my contact information below.
